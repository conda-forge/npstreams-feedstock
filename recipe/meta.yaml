  summary: Streaming operations on NumPy arrays
  description: |
    npstreams is an open-source Python package for streaming NumPy array operations.
    The goal is to provide tested routines that operate on streams (or generators) 
    of arrays instead of dense arrays. Streaming reduction operations (sums, averages, etc.) 
    can be implemented in constant memory, which in turns allows for easy parallelization.
